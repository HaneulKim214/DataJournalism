part I:
- From the data set downloaded from [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml) which is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimate the goal is to visualize how people are doing in terms of keeping a healthy lifestyle.

- Include 3 labels for each x and y axis therefore user can see 9 different correlations. Plotting dynamically built allowing the user to play around and get insights.

Part II:
- From the visualization, write down visible insights that could be used to ask further questions to reduce errors and bias.

The data set included is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml), but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."
